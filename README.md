# Five-Fun-Projects-for-Beginners
A list of five fun projects that beginner programmers can start doing today.

There are so many different open source projects on the internet today. In order to narrow down some of these, I have selectd five projects that I have found to be intersting and easy for beginner programmers to start contributing to. These projectes include three games and two other projects.

1. 2048 - A game written in C++ that runs in terminal on Linux and Mac where you press keys to move tiles. When two tiles of the same number touch, they turn into one tile and add their numbers together. The object is to get one tile to the number 2048.
